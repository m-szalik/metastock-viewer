/**
 * A financial instrument with daily OHLC in raw and

 * that is, some instruments are measured in points (the indexes
 * such as the DOW or the FTSE) while some other are measured in
 * Dollar amounts (most securities).
 * <p>The field <code>offDays</code> is an array of <code>int</code>s
 * that contains -1 if on that precise date, the market for that
 * instrument was closed, or the index of that date otherwise.
 * <p>The field <code>quotes</code> contains the extended <code>Quote</code>
 * data, that is, including business days on which the market for that
 * instrument was closed.
 * <p>The field <code>rawQuotes</code> contains only those dates on
 * which the instrument was actually traded.
 * <p>The reason why we have two set of quotes is because comparisons
 * between instruments wouldn't be possible if the dates didn't match
 * on one hand, and because on the other hand, on a given instrument, the
 * non traded days are mostly irrelevant.
